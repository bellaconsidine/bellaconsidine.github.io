From the moment you are born, you are (due to a combination of chemical, biological and psychological factors, all colliding in your mothers’ brain) loved, and this is generally where the problems begin. You are then loved against your will, either with open arms or cold shoulders, forced into obedience for fear of losing it and it’s comforts, later into half-baked relationships that you invest into expectantly like bonds or shares, sometimes abused, sometimes abusive, at times blissful, at other times cruel. A self-inflicted polarity to give your life in the hopes of avoiding the mundane, eg. the sound of clicks onto emails and small talk in cramped elevators, all to say:
This is it
I have it
At last, my lonely days are over
And by all known sources, it is good, depending on how you do it- like Christianity or instant noodles. And now, I am sure, I will die without it. And perhaps it was my luck. It was because I was not lucky enough to find that poor soul intertwined with mine. Maybe it died in a coal mine in Indonesia twenty years ago, maybe it sat next to me while I was asleep on the train. Or perhaps I didn’t try hard enough. If I had compromised more, given more, abided more, I would be content. All this work solely for the allure of being understood, completely. Not misheard or casually thrust through crowded rooms and endless conversation, before being removed into a corner. Here was someone who had dunked their hands into my limbic tissue- and against all logic, found overwhelming pleasure in doing it too. 
But each year that passes is another stacked on top of the others. Each year is another left to be understood- another year I have been reworked and rewired, and each year I drift further into myself. And who would love me now? Now that I am falling off the bone. 
But I have found that the love that has given me the most satisfaction is the one that is most pitied. Unrequited love. After all, why should love be any better when it is given back, except for shallow gratification? A dessert that tastes you back isn’t any sweeter. There is no truly painless love except unrequited love, even a dog bites back. 
I do not mean the unrequited love of staring at women on buses, staring at girls in coffee shops or in their homes through binoculars, though God knows I’ve tried. That is why I’ve given in to loving things instead of people- let’s say, watches instead of women. When a watch stops, it is not lying, like women do, when it dies it isn’t dead forever, it can be fixed. It can be fixed because it is perfect, it will live for as long as I love it. And who is harmed in the process?
But of course it isn’t only watches I love- that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Among my wives are cars, radios, stereos, vinyl, magazines, shoes, coats, cigar boxes, art. I can say that these items, the objects of my affection, were made for me more than any woman, man or breathing article roaming through the streets. Can you say the same of your love? Mine are usable endlessly and at my service alone. And can you say the same of yours? Perhaps you would love to be free of the hassle, the unanswered phone calls, the jealousy sliding between bedsheets, the queasy comfort of silent breakfasts and dinners eaten while watching TV. Tell me, is what you really love worth more than who you say you love infinitely?
