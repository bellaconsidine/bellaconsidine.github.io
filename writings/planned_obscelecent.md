I found myself on a sofa at six o clock in the morning. All that bollocks about the missing Malaysian air flight was on tv again. I try not to think about him anymore, but I couldn’t help wondering what my dad would make of it all. I remember how after him and my mom broke up he’d lie on the sofa of his flat all day wearing this kind of throwaway broken bulldog look on his face, watching airplane crash documentaries. God knows what channel decided to play airplane crash documentaries all day, what a hoot. I remember being about the size of his big toe, sinking under into the carpet with the litter and flyaway crumbs. Well anyway I was thinking about how if they ever found that plane anywhere, it was on that sofa. I could see it all, the passengers and pilots and air hostesses gawping at the TV on the shrapnel shredded floor. The tattered plane lounging on that same sofa, illuminated by a huge wreck of a hole in the ceiling just above, a flaming pillow smoking next to its nose. It made me chuckle. Watching yourself on the BBC news, now that’s the dream.

The way I see it, we’re all just victims of our own ambitions. I had no qualifications, no credibility, not a penny or a name and I still managed to find a job and even though it’s what I wanted to do I hated it, I thought I had no free will anymore but now I want it back. Even if you make it up to the top the chances are you’ll end up face down in your own swimming pool with a cocktail of uppers and downers in your system. The maid who finds you will get another job on a bigger estate. God I’d love a swimming pool. 

I can’t stand waking up early, there are too many hours in the day you spend waiting for that one thing that keeps you chugging along like the miserable tank engine you are and when that thing is over you pine for the next thing. Why do you think kids love Christmas? I used to get so excited to wake up with presents at the end of my bed in the morning that I’d end up waking up before the damn things were there. Some people will say that’s self-sabotage, I’m the best self-saboteur I’ve ever met because I do it with the best intentions. I’m like the mum who will give his son all the sweets he could ever want until he’s so fat he needs a heart transplant and she gives him her own heart. I’m like that, I’ll give myself my own heart and eat it. 

The morning was a cruel one. A papier-mâché of grey and white clouds of differing depth altered sun for moments, but it was the nasty whiteness of the light that killed shadows and dimensions with it. It was a stubborn sky that lied, touching teeth, daring not to spit encase it pleased plants. People seemed to move through pavements and walls and would dim in the lights undimming. They looked like they had lost their minds- not gone mad but gone altogether. 

I love London. I don’t mean to sound like a souvenir but it’s true. You read all about how bad the pollution is and how it kills brain cells blah blah blah I took a big old nihilistic breath in anyway. What I love about this place is the endless yammering on of it, how it refuses to give up on its own loud consumption and creation. It’s like a big belly getting bigger and bouncier by the minute. It’s hungry, I’m hungry. I must have been walking up an appetite because I pretty much nose-dived into the Café. 

They brought me tea instead of coffee but I drank it anyway. I was thinking about my ex-girlfriend. She took me to this groggy old bench that looked like it was about to crumble into two when she bit the bullet. It was next to this pond which was more of a glorified puddle. I remember how foggy it was, it was like something out of Wuthering Heights to be exact. For a moment I thought Kate Bush might mosey her way out of the mud. She told me it wasn’t working and all the regular sop and tottered away, into the mist. They found this body in that pond a week or so later that had been stabbed ninety-six times. Ninety-six, that’s really throwing a brick in the washing machine. I thought I went mad forking the plastic film on those microwave meals but ninety-six times, that’s over-doing it. I always wondered why she made me meet her at some spot that we’d never even gone to, but I found out it was because she was sticking some guy up the road. I wish them many happy lake-side picnics. 

This day was not significant. Leaves moved, things changed position. Foot followed foot in, out and around cracks in the pavement, past ground things and other covered toes. The world rolls imperceptibly. I move closer to you and you away from me. 

I left the café feeling like a sick dog. Eating your own weight in grease is supposed to cure a hangover but I must be doubting everything I’ve been told because it’s not working any wonders for me. I have to decide how to be happy again. The buddha did it by realising he didn’t need to be happy then boom, nirvana. Its paradoxical, the whole thing is that you’ll be happy when you don’t even want it anymore. What a catch 22. Maybe if I didn’t want a six-storey house with a jacuzzi, I’d be in my hot tub telling a reporter how much I wished I was an unemployed journalist with no money, I was barely ever a journalist anyway. I reckon if I decided I didn’t want to be happy I’d probably go looney and chop my own ear off but you can’t even do that without being sent to some kind of institution, it’s ridiculous. If a man wants to chop his own ear off I say let him do it. We’re supposed to be ‘free’ and all but somehow that doesn’t include completely consensual self-injury. I guess the law is there to stop you doing something you might regret. I mean wearing sunglasses becomes a hell of a lot more difficult after chopping off your own ear, and good luck seeing a movie in 3D. Though they do lose their appeal by the time you’re fourteen. I doubt anyone under fourteen would consider chopping their own ear off anyway, that really would require institutionalization. 

Well something like that must be going on because there are all these “knife-free” posters around London, they must’ve been stuck up overnight. You can barely turn a street corner without a print of a sombre teenager looking you straight in the eye, reminding you not to stab anyone. It’s like living in the purge, now we need adverts to tell us not to kill each other. Maybe they should legalize guns. Look at America- their knife crime is lower than our ankles, it’s putting us to shame. Plus let’s face it, guns are cool. Did you know that the second biggest cause of gun injuries in the States is toddlers accidently shooting their parents? I don’t know about you but I’d much rather my toddler shot me to death than stabbed me. 

            “What d’you want, then?”
“Pint of Stella please.”

I hate Stella. As soon as a wide man talks to me with a rough enough accent I feel compelled to accommodate. It makes you into a little kid again. I’m scrawny and my hair’s kind of thin. People like him tend to hate me because they think I’m the intellectual type and intellectual types hate me because I’m not intellectual enough. He slammed the glass down in front of me. I always thought that beer looks like urine. I knew this guy who would drink his own urine at parties, it was his party-trick. Poor guy never did understand why he’d never get invited to any.

    “That’ll be six-fifty.”

How the hell are they allowed to charge so much? I could’ve bought a six pack for that much but drinking alone in your apartment is somehow sadder than wasting your last dime in this flea-hole. I wondered if I’d end up like the bartender at this pub serving boozers all day but decided I’m too socially inept, they’d never hire me. I started watching him; the bartender. His movements were rigid and uninterrupted and strong. Mine are clunky and half-baked, I’m a donut. I guess he must’ve seen me puzzling over him because he looked up, straight at me. My eyes darted away fast enough to make me look like a coy school-boy eyeing his crush. He drifted toward me in this deliberate fashion that prepared me for an oncoming conversation.

“Alright then. So what is it you do that brings you to the pub at eleven on a weekday?”
He poured a shot of whiskey that I half-hoped was for me but instead glugged the whole thing down like he was eating a peanut.
“I’m a journalist.”
“A journalist!”
He boomed with demeaning enthusiasm.
“So you work for The Sun or something like that?”
“No- well they do stuff about celebrity under-skirts and nip-slips. That’s more of a magazine for broads really.”
I’ve never said ‘broads’ before in my life. 
“I’m not big on reading myself,” He elaborated. “I prefer television, the movies. I wanted to be an actor myself. Went to acting school, cost a bloody fortune. And look at me now, I’m the king of The Kings Head.”
With the words waved a cloth to cement his imperial conquest. I wasn’t too sure what to say, especially since some cloth juice had sprayed into my eye.
“You look fine.” 
“What d’you write about then? if it’s not nip slips.”
“All sorts of things…train collisions, bank robberies, airplane crashes... Isis. You know, anything people will force themselves to read. But I quit a week ago, that’s why I’m here.” 
I took this sort of nervous gulp from my glass. I hadn’t talked to anyone in a while to be honest.
“Ahh, so when you said “journalist” you meant ‘unemployed’. No need to worry son, most of the blokes in here are ‘journalists’ too.”
I laughed. “Yeah, and the rest of them work for The Daily Mail.”
His eyes were deep and black, black holes whose current would suck you under and spaghettify you. His best years seemed behind him, if he had any good ones. That seems harsh, but his under-eyes were lined with a purple that I doubt was remnant eyeshadow from the night before- his cracked face was the work of many nights, a combined effort. 
“You’ve finished your drink,”
I looked down, he was right. It occurred to me that beer is the colour of gold too.
