How are father/son relationships presented in Hamlet and Things Fall Apart?

Shakespeare and Achebe may be separated by time and place, but fathers are a universal phenomenon and therefore of interest to writers. If the adolescent trope that parents ruin one’s life, as argued by Philip Larkin in This be the Verse, has any merit, Hamlet and Things Fall Apart are ideal literary examples. In fact, both these authors create fathers with whom the blame seems to rest. As every work of fiction is irrevocably intertwined with the context of its’ production, my chosen texts are particularly intriguing in terms of their background. Things Fall Apart was written in 1958, two years before Nigerian Independence. This was a tumultuous, uncertain time as the country would have to decide whether to unravel English hierarchies and go back to a pre-colonial Ibo past or succumb to a western way of life. Hamlet, on the other hand, was written at a time of religious turmoil. Shakespeare creates a battle ground of the alternative views of theism that reflected Elizabethan England, in the words of Hamlet- “there is more to the heavens and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy”. Could this be Shakespeare implying the radical idea that our lack of free will is due to our earthly fathers rather than the almighty father?

Though the childhood of each protagonist is speculative, an estimation can be made from the text. Hamlet’s profuse use of hyperbole when talking of his father, “Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself, / an eye like mars… a station like the herald mercury”, shows his effusive and idealised view of his father and is indicative of his influence on Hamlet’s early life. It can be likened to the way a child may venerate their seemingly invincible father. Hamlet’s deification of his father is almost too good to be true, and the audience may perceive the father/son relationship to be one of distance and reverence. However, this contrasts with the way Shakespeare presents Hamlet’s relationship with Yorick, which seems to be one of carefree closeness and nurture, “here hung those lips that’s I have kissed I know not how oft”. The physical nature of this afterlife reunion is in contrast to the spiritual meeting of him and his father at the beginning of the play in which the ghost hangs aloofly above him hollering imperious commands. It not only reflects the hierarchical juxtaposition of king and jester in courtly life, but the ways their roles in court affected their interpersonal relationships with a young Hamlet. This is also true of Hamlet’s relationship with most of the other characters in the court. For instance, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s friendship with Hamlet is false, simulated in order to “Get from him why he puts on his confusion” at Claudius’ behest. The greater use of the personal pronoun by Shakespeare when Hamlet talks to a deceased Yorick, “he hath bore me on his back a thousand times”, also indicates the warm familiarity, physical and emotional, between Yorick and Hamlet that may have been viewed as almost maternal in nature during Shakespeare’s era. As the critic Harold Bloom has suggested, “The only vital relationship Hamlet has ever had was with Yorick…Yorick the jester was Hamlet's true father and mother" (Bloom, 2003).  

Achebe and Shakespeare both create protagonists that are almost the antithesis of each other. Not only is Hamlet haunted by his father, he is also haunted by the morality of being, and caught between action and inaction, “to be or not to be”. Achebe’s protagonist is haunted by his father’s laziness, the fear of not doing. Okonkwo is described as having “no patience” for his father, who was “lazy” and “shameful”. Hamlet is inconsistent in both his thoughts and actions. Although Hamlet is certain that if his uncle is guilty he should die, he asserts that he must be certain that he is before committing to the murder, “The spirit I have seen may be a devil... (who) abuses me to damn me”. Which would follow the Elizabethan religious ideals at the time that God is the only one with the authority to exact vengeance. However he feels no remorse at the killing of Polonius, choosing instead to berate his mother for her incestuous marriage to “a murderer and a villain”, while disregarding the murder he committed. Achebe’s protagonist also struggles with his own morality and the wishes of the gods, and like Hamlet, his actions would speak differently to the inner workings of his thoughts. Okonkwo only chooses to take part in the killing of Ikemefuma, who “could hardly imagine that Okonkwo was not his real father”, because “He was afraid of being thought weak.” In cutting down Ikemefuma, Okonkwo is shown as fighting against his fathers perceived weakness due to his “fear of blood”, violence. The difficult complexity that the writers portray in the characters would be detestable had it not been that the reader/audience understands that their tragedies are inherited. The fact that the first tragedy of the texts, the death of the fathers, is integral to the narrative even though their death happens previously to when the plot is set, gives the reader a premonition of the protagonists being tragic heroes from the start. This allows the reader to “adopt a character's goals and use their own planning procedures to connect actions together meaningfully” (Oatley, 1995). This means that Hamlets fickleness and Okonkwo’s stubbornness are not abstract from the reader, we can see that the lives and deaths of each father is the catalyst of the tragic events to come. The writers create characters that must survive in the wake of the damage that their fathers bestow on them.

Shakespeare creates an environment of surveillance in the court of Elsinore that reflected Elizabethan England, where social order, power and spies, instigated by Elizabeth I, aroused paranoia. England’s father, the monarchy, was abusive and unequal. The religious conflict sparked by Henry VIII in the creation of the church of England split the country in two and the country’s people had to decide between conforming to the state or being righteous and affirming their faith to a true God. Achebe, on the other hand, uses Okonwo and Unoko’s dysfunctional relationship to reflect Britain’s neglectful ‘fathering’ of Nigeria and pose tough questions about Nigeria’s independence, and wonders what country it will become. 

(CRITICS, Bloom and Greenblatt) Authors use father figures to ask whether people are truly capable of change and whether the characters are ultimately doomed by their fathers or doomed by themselves. While Shakespeare creates a character who spends most of the time mulling over his father and the philosophy of his decisions, Achebe creates a protagonist who fails to look introspectively on his own ideals and acts without thought. Each writer uses fathers to set up a fatal flaw that may have created the tragic hero that defined the plot of the novel/play. 


 


"Something in Hamlet dies before the play opens, and I set aside the prevalent judgment that the deepest cause of his melancholia is his mourning for the dead father and his outrage at his mother's sexuality,"

The form that each writer uses to convey their ideas is significant in the impact that they leave on their reader or audience. Achebe’s decision to write a third person narrative novel gives the reader a balanced view of the events that transpire. The omniscient narrator of Things Fall Apart tells us who Okonkwo is, including the things he can’t admit to himself about how his father dominated his view of life. For example, “Okonkwo never showed any emotion openly” to be as unlike his father as possible. A post-colonial reading of this text, allows us to see how Achebe uses Okonwo’s dysfunctional relationship with his father to reflect Britain’s neglectful fathering of Nigeria. Achebe poses tough questions about Nigeria’s independence, and invites the reader to contemplate the country’s future. At the mention of his father Okonkwo says nothing, however we understand that this is due to his shame because the narrator explains it to us in the first chapter. Had Achebe chosen to express his ideas as Shakespeare, in a play format, Things Fall Apart might have lacked the depth of setting and community that is key to the construction of the original Nigerian perspective of the novel. In contrast Shakespeare’s decision to write a play derides from setting and into the construction of the characters themselves. This allows Shakespeare to communicate his message that fate is unknowable, uncontrollable and inescapable and destiny may not be only Gods creation, things that Hamlet acknowledges, “the time is out of joint. O cursed spite That I was ever born to set it right”.

Although Elizabethan England and Ibo Nigeria would seem very different places, the idea of fate or “chi” is prevalent in each text. Fate in literature has been described as “The primary point of departure is man's dualistic experience of coming up against an exterior power stronger than himself, which thwarts his actions and intentions.” Both Achebe and Shakespeare oppose the idea of religious fate with inherited fate, the idea that fate is a product of the Gods or our predecessors. Free will is also a recurrent theme in both texts. Okonkwo believes that fate, the wishes of the gods, is inescapable. The “ill fated” Ikemefuma is destined to tragedy from the start, “(Okonkwo) came to look after the doomed lad who was sacrificed to the village of Umuofia by their neighbours to avoid war and bloodshed”. Ikemefuma carries with him an inevitable fate. His death at the hands of his father establishes the role of fathers not only giving life but playing a role in death as well. 
















Shakespeare uses dialogue to convey social deception and how the characters interact while 
Furthermore Shakespeare uses monologues to convey .The writers use these formats to allow the readers to look at the events unfolding as unbiased and rounded instead of the bias that a first person narrator would give. However, both writers position us to empathise with the protagonists. Hamlet could be seen as a selfish narcissistic, too caught up with whining and dallying to take any decisive action. However by using poetic language and heartfelt prose encompassing ubiquitous emotions, we’re encouraged to see him as more of a tragic hero.  





When his adopted son is ordered to be killed

The first point of comparison is Shakespeare and Achebe’s creation of a protagonist whose hamartia is incited by the need to avenge their fathers. A Jacobean audience will have already anticipated Hamlets death in the 

Delving into morality, fate and consequences, the authors position their characters in a state of internal conflict. One must kill his father’s murderer, his own uncle, while the other feels he must become so great that the memory of his father is blotted out of existence altogether. Both reflect Greek tragedy tropes, EXAMPLE



God/personal vengeance






Both texts are odes to paternal sufferings and how they influence. The protagonist from either text has an opposing view of their fathers.. His compulsive urge to be unlike his father is how he gained the wealth and status that gave him the motivation to rise to power in the clan. Okonkwo believes that being the antithesis of his father Unoko will lead him to the power and success his father never had. “One passion- to hate everything Unoka had loved. One of these things was gentleness and the other was idleness.” To Okonkwo, Unoka embodies the passivity and submission that he sees as inherently female. Though this is the reason for his headstrong work-ethic and determination, he mistakes gentleness, and all things he sees as feminine, as weakness due to his submissive father. “His whole life was dominated by fear and the fear of weakness.” His blunt masculinity creates his characteristic blind anger and impulsive actions that lead to his eventual downfall. (FEMINIST READING)

  

Achebe and Shakespeare use the dichotomy of paternal love and hate to create tragic heroes. Both Okonkwo and Hamlet are driven insane in attempts to either oppose or emulate their fathers. Okonkwo’s shame compels him to oppose his father’s hedonistic lifestyle in every way, his inflexibility and aggressive is the fatal flaw that leads him firstly to the beating of Ojuigo on peace week. Not only does this show his failure to think before his actions, it also shows that his anger often overrides common sense, “his two wives ran out in great alarm pleading that it was the week of peace. But Okonkwo was not a man to stop beating someone half way through, not even for a goddess.” His disrespect for the earth goddess in this chapter may be symbolic of his disrespect of women, in particular all things he views as womanly. It is all the more ironic then that his reason for banishment is a ‘female’ crime when patriarchal values are so key to his identity. He calls his son Nyoye “a woman” ???? for the  Unlike Okonkwo’s rigid stubborn commitment of action over thought, Hamlets mulls over life and death, crime and punishment and the urge to kill Claudius that he cannot act on. Inversely to Okonkwo, when he does act he has killed Polonius and not Claudius. Throughout the play Hamlet not only dismisses femininity, he disregards everything in the obsession of avenging his father. Everything in his life is secondary to his purpose, to kill his uncle, and yet he cannot find the time or will to do it. Though the ghost of Hamlets father is crucial in unravelling the tragedy- it is Hamlets love for him as opposed to Okonkwo’s hate that determines his fate. Even before seeing the ghost hamlet refers to his father as “so excellent a king, that was to this//Hyperion to a satyr”, in this hyperbolic comparison Hamlet denigrates his uncle while idolizing his father. When addressing the ghost of his father he speaks of him as having “canonized bones”. The language Hamlet uses when speaking of his father is celestial and abundant in religious connotations. Horatio speaks of “the last king” as “valiant Hamlet”, he fought Norway and won- a man of action. Unlike Okonkwo, Hamlet is not concerned in having the status and prowess that his father possessed. However, like Okonkwo, he is an opposite of his father. Despite sharing a name, the king Hamlet is a decisive, heroic leader. While Hamlet is a philosopher who reflects, but much of the time fails to act.
During Hamlets excursion to England following his accidental crime and Okonwo’s banishment, they both seem to lack remorse for their actions. Upon killing Polonius Hamlet says “A bloody deed? Almost as bad good mother, as kill a king and marry his brother.” Just as Hamlets excuse for his bad deeds is the death of his father and betrayal of his mother, Okonkwo blames his chi, which was once a symbol for his great destiny, “Okonkwo said yes very strongly so his chi agreed”. When he was doing well, he believed his destiny for greatness would be a product of work and not luck. However when everything turns sour Both of them also seem to lack any punishment for when they have done wrong.

When the white man arrives in Umofia and “things fall apart”, Okonkwos need, and  for respect in the tribe is threatened by the white man’s insatiable appetite for power over Nigeria. After attempts to torture and so silence him “they neither spoke to anyone nor anyone else”. After he does speak up and get a town meeting together, he strikes down a court messenger who tried to break it up, saying nothing, which ultimately begets him his death. Umofia hero In Ibo culture suicide is a taboo, however when Okonkwo hangs himself it is ambiguous as to whether it was an act of defiance or if he was giving up hope. His tribespeople cannot touch the body, but his death is allegorical of the death of Ibo and Umofia’s culture. Although he could never be the to save Umofia he died trying. Even the commissioner wouldn’t “attend to such undignified details” as taking down the body. Unoka also dies what the tribe would call a shameful death, “he died and rotted away above the earth and was not given the first of the second burial.” While both him and his father die in an Ibo taboo- Unoka is left to rot alone in the evil forest while Okonkwo hangs as a flag of rebellion, swaying despondently as Obrieka gazes up at him in memoriam of a dying society.  Every action that lead him to his death, and his death itself was a rejection of his father. A plight possessing the hardness of a rock, rather than the gentle fluidity and compliancy of water that his father- in the same situation- would have had. 

Both Hamlet and Okonkwo find themselves haunted by their fathers, though perhaps not in the exact same way. Despite this, had they hypothetically met, Okonkwo may have agreed with Hamlet that “conscience makes cowards of us all”.
